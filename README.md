# ESP32 BLE HID Keyboard for ESPHome

This is a custom ESPHome component that transforms an ESP32 into a Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE) HID Keyboard. This component currently targets **ESP-IDF Bluedroid GATTS** (rather than NimBLE), chosen for the HID behavior and host compatibility validated in this project.

## Features

* **Standard HID Keyboard:** Recognized as a native keyboard by Windows, Android, and iOS. Full HOGP-compliant BLE HID with Device Information and Battery services. Use `passkey_mode: legacy` for Windows/Android, `passkey_mode: secure_connections` for iOS.
* **Secure Pairing:** Supports a configurable 6-digit static passkey (PIN) for secure bonding, with automatic Android compatibility fallback in `passkey_mode: legacy`.
* **Efficient Memory Usage:** Direct API implementation ensures stability even with complex ESPHome configurations.
* **Key Combos:** Send any modifier + key combination using hex keycodes (e.g. Win+R, Ctrl+C).
* **String Typing:** Type any string directly — all printable ASCII characters are supported (US keyboard layout).
* **Pre-defined Actions:** Built-in helpers for `ctrl_alt_del`, `sleep`, `hibernate` and `shutdown`.
* **Media Keys:** Control volume, playback, mute and more via HID consumer control.
* **Power Button:** Native HID power/sleep signals — no Run dialog, clean OS-level control.
* **Consumer Control:** Send any HID consumer code directly from YAML using `consumer:0xXXXX` syntax.
* **Custom Text Input:** Send any text typed in Home Assistant directly to the paired host device.

## Configuration Variables

### `espidf_ble_keyboard`

* **id** (Required, ID): The ID used to link buttons or automations to this keyboard.
* **device_name** (Optional, string): The BLE device name advertised during pairing. Defaults to `ESP32 BLE KB`. Maximum 29 characters.
* **key_delay_ms** (Optional, int): Total delay per character when typing strings, in milliseconds. Split evenly between key-down and key-up. Defaults to `80`. Increase if characters are being dropped on slow BLE connections.
* **passkey** (Optional, int): A 6-digit static PIN (000000–999999). If set, the device uses static passkey pairing (legacy MITM bond) and requires this PIN during initial pairing.
* **passkey_mode** (Optional, string): Passkey security mode. `legacy` (default) uses legacy MITM bonding — tested and recommended for Windows and Android. `secure_connections` uses LE Secure Connections MITM bonding — tested and recommended for iOS.

### `button` (Platform: `espidf_ble_keyboard`)

* **keyboard_id** (Required, ID): The ID of the `espidf_ble_keyboard` component.
* **action** (Required, string or mapping): The action to perform when the button is pressed. Accepts either a string or a dict with `type` key (see below).

### `binary_sensor` (Platform: `espidf_ble_keyboard`)

* **keyboard_id** (Required, ID): The ID of the `espidf_ble_keyboard` component.
* **name** (Optional, string): Friendly entity name shown in Home Assistant.

State behavior:

* **ON** = a `GAP: Pairing Successful` event occurred on the current connection.
* **OFF** = keyboard is disconnected (including host-side unpair) or not yet paired in this session.

#### Action Types

| Action | Description |
|---|---|
| `"Hello\n"` | Type a string. Use `\n` for Enter. All printable ASCII characters supported (US layout). |
| `"combo:0x08:0x15"` | Send a key combination. Format: `combo:<modifier_hex>:<keycode_hex>`. Use `0x00` as modifier for no modifier key. See [Keycode Reference](docs/keycodes.md). |
| `"combo:0x00:0x04"` | Send a plain keypress with no modifier. `0x04` = A, `0x05` = B ... `0x1D` = Z. |
| `"consumer:0x0192"` | Send any HID consumer control code. Format: `consumer:<usage_hex>`. See [Keycode Reference](docs/keycodes.md) for full list. |
| `"ctrl_alt_del"` | Send the Ctrl+Alt+Del secure login sequence. |
| `"sleep"` | HID System Sleep signal — clean OS-level sleep. |
| `"hibernate"` | Hibernate the PC — saves to disk, full power off. Requires `powercfg /hibernate on`. |
| `"shutdown"` | HID System Power Down signal — clean OS-level shutdown. |
| `"power"` | HID power button — triggers Windows power button action. |
| `"mute"` | Toggle mute. |
| `"volume_up"` | Volume up. |
| `"volume_down"` | Volume down. |
| `"play_pause"` | Play / pause media. |
| `"next_track"` | Skip to next track. |
| `"prev_track"` | Previous track. |
| `"stop"` | Stop media playback. |

## Dict Action Format

Instead of a string, `action` also accepts a mapping with a `type` key. This can be more readable for complex actions:

```yaml
# Combo — modifier + key
action:
  type: combo
  modifier: 0x01   # 0x00 = none, 0x01 = Ctrl, 0x02 = Shift, 0x04 = Alt, 0x08 = Win
  key: 0x04        # 0x04 = A ... 0x1D = Z, see Keycode Reference

# Plain keypress — no modifier
action:
  type: combo
  modifier: 0x00
  key: 0x04        # Just 'A'

# Consumer control
action:
  type: consumer
  code: 0x0192     # Open Calculator
```

Both formats are equivalent — the dict format is converted to the string format at compile time so there is no runtime difference.

## Custom Text Input

You can send arbitrary text from Home Assistant to the paired host device without hardcoding it in the YAML. Add the following to your ESPHome config:

```yaml
text:
  - platform: template
    name: "Custom Text"
    id: custom_text
    mode: text
    optimistic: true

button:
  - platform: template
    name: "Send Custom Text"
    on_press:
      - lambda: |-
          id(my_keyboard).send_string(id(custom_text).state);
```

This adds a text input field and a send button to Home Assistant. You can also drive it from a Home Assistant automation — for example, updating the text entity from an `input_text` helper and then pressing the button:

```yaml
automation:
  - alias: "Send text via BLE keyboard"
    trigger:
      - platform: state
        entity_id: input_text.ble_keyboard_text
    action:
      - service: text.set_value
        target:
          entity_id: text.bluetooth_keyboard_custom_text
        data:
          value: "{{ states('input_text.ble_keyboard_text') }}"
      - service: button.press
        target:
          entity_id: button.bluetooth_keyboard_send_custom_text
```

> **Note:** All printable ASCII characters and tab are supported (US keyboard layout). Non-ASCII and control characters are silently skipped.

## Pairing with Windows

When you first flash the device or change the `passkey`:

1. Open **Bluetooth & other devices** on Windows.
2. If your device name (default: "ESP32 BLE KB") is already listed, **Remove Device**.
3. Click **Add device** -> **Bluetooth**.
4. Select your device name (default: "ESP32 BLE KB").
5. Windows will prompt you to enter the PIN. Type your configured `passkey` (e.g., `123456`) and click **Connect**.

---

## Pairing with Android

Android is stricter about BLE HID security than Windows. For best results:

1. Configure a 6-digit `passkey` in `espidf_ble_keyboard`.
2. Flash firmware, then restart Bluetooth on the phone (or reboot phone once).
3. In Android Bluetooth settings, remove any previous entry for your device name (default: **ESP32 BLE KB**) before re-pairing.
4. Start pairing and enter the configured passkey when prompted.

If Android shows a different host-generated code instead of your configured passkey, remove old bonds on both Android and the ESP32 side (reboot/reflash), then pair again.

If pairing repeatedly fails with auth error `0x51` in `passkey_mode: legacy`, this component automatically falls back from static passkey mode to Just Works mode for compatibility on the next attempt.

If pairing fails with "can't connect", remove the old bond on Android and pair again after rebooting the ESP32.

---

## Pairing with iOS

For iOS using passkey pairing:

1. Set `passkey` and `passkey_mode: secure_connections` in `espidf_ble_keyboard`.
2. Remove any previous bond for your device name (default: **ESP32 BLE KB**) from iOS Bluetooth settings.
3. Reboot the ESP32 (or reflash), then pair again from iOS.
4. Enter the configured passkey when prompted.

After pairing, you should see all CCC subscriptions in the log (keyboard, consumer, system) confirming iOS has fully enumerated the HID service.

Notes:

* `passkey_mode: secure_connections` is the tested and recommended mode for iOS.
* The component includes Device Information and Battery services required by iOS for HOGP (HID over GATT Profile) compliance.
* macOS is expected to work the same way but has not been explicitly tested.

---

## Known Working Pairing Notes

The current implementation has been validated on Windows, Android, and iOS.
Tested on Windows 11, Android 16, and iOS.
For first-time pairing, Android may require more than one attempt while it refreshes BLE cache and bond state.

Recommended pairing modes:

* **Fastest pairing (recommended default):** Omit `passkey` (Just Works). Windows and Android typically pair instantly.
* **Windows/Android with passkey:** Set `passkey` with `passkey_mode: legacy` (default). Windows typically pairs quickly; Android may require a second attempt before fallback completes.
* **iOS with passkey:** Set `passkey` with `passkey_mode: secure_connections`.

Recommended order:

1. Turn off Bluetooth on other nearby hosts (especially Windows) to avoid auto-connect races.
2. Remove old keyboard entries from the phone/PC.
3. Retry pairing from the target host.

After the first successful bond, reconnect behavior is typically stable.

## Troubleshooting

* **Not appearing in search:** Ensure no other device is currently connected. The ESP32 stops advertising once a connection is established.
* **PIN prompt not appearing:** Windows often caches old security profiles. Fully "Remove" the device from Windows Bluetooth settings and try again.
* **Windows needs multiple pairing attempts:** Remove old Bluetooth entries first, then retry pairing after the first failed attempt. The component now avoids duplicate advertising restarts and keeps existing bonds unless the auth failure is a known `0x51` mismatch.
* **Android says "can't connect":** Android often keeps stale BLE bonds. Remove the device from Bluetooth settings, reboot the ESP32, then pair again. If still failing, toggle phone Bluetooth off/on and retry.
* **Android shows the wrong pairing code:** Ensure `passkey` is set in YAML and old bonds are removed before pairing. If Android still shows a host-generated code, remove all existing bonds and pair from a clean state. In `passkey_mode: legacy`, the component can automatically fall back to Just Works mode after repeated `0x51` auth failures.
* **iOS not pairing:** Set `passkey_mode: secure_connections`, remove old Bluetooth bonds on both devices, then pair again.
* **iOS pairs but no typing/control:** Ensure you are using `passkey_mode: secure_connections`. Remove the bond on both the iOS device and the ESP32 (reboot/reflash), then pair again. After pairing, check the log for `Consumer CCC=0x0001` and `System CCC=0x0001` — if these are missing, iOS has not fully subscribed to the HID reports. Reflash and re-pair from a clean state.
* **Typing speed / dropped characters:** The default `key_delay_ms: 80` (40ms key-down + 40ms key-up) suits most connections. If characters are dropped on a slow BLE connection, increase this value (e.g. `key_delay_ms: 120`). If typing feels too slow, it can be reduced.
* **Hibernate not working:** Hibernate uses the Windows Run dialog. Ensure the PC is not in a state where it is blocked (e.g., fullscreen app or UAC prompt). Also ensure hibernate is enabled: run `powercfg /hibernate on` in an admin command prompt.
* **PC not waking from sleep:** Check that **USB Wake Support** (or similar) is enabled in your BIOS/UEFI Power Management settings.
* **Re-pair after firmware update:** If the HID descriptor changes (e.g. after adding media keys), you must remove and re-pair the device in Windows Bluetooth settings.
